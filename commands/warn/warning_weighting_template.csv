Severity;Warning
A;"Multiple Rooms are in the same enclosed region.  The correct area and perimeter will be assigned to one Room and the others will display ""Redundant Room.""  You should separate the regions, delete the extra Rooms, or move them into different regions."
A;"Could not create Wall Sweep. Sweep position is outside of its wall. Please check sweep parameters."
A;"Could not create Wall Sweep. Two wall sweeps are overlapping."
A;"Rectangular opening doesn't cut its host."
A;"There are identical instances in the same place. This will result in double counting in schedules."
A;"Can't make monolithic Stairs."
A;"Elements have duplicate 'Type Mark' values."
A;"An elevation symbol references views on more than one sheet. It will show a blank sheet reference. To show the correct references, use a separate elevation symbol for the views on each sheet."
A;"The Actual Run Width of one or more runs is less than the Minimum Run Width specified in the stair type."
A;"Stair bottom end exceeds or cannot reach the base elevation of the stair. Add/remove risers at the bottom end by control or change the stair run's 'Relative Base Height' parameter in the properties palette."
A;"Stair components are not continuously connected. This may cause incorrect representation and annotation."
A;"The Actual Tread Depth of stair is less than the Minimum Tread Depth specified in the stair type."
A;"Stair top end exceeds or cannot reach the top elevation of the stair. Add/remove risers at the top end by control or or change the stair run's 'Relative Top Height' parameter in the properties palette."
A;"Top reference is below Bottom reference for one or more Balusters. These Balusters are not created."
A;"The highlighted column can't maintain attachment to the target.  It will be treated as unattached until it can intersect."
A;"There are identical instances in the same place. This will result in double counting in schedules. You can tab-select one of the overlapping elements to exclude it from the group instance."
A;"Highlighted walls are attached to, but miss, the highlighted targets."
A;"Grid is slightly off axis and may cause inaccuracies."
B;"Room separation line is slightly off axis and may cause inaccuracies."
B;"Line in Sketch is slightly off axis and may cause inaccuracies."
B;"Wall is slightly off axis and may cause inaccuracies."
B;"Highlighted room separation lines overlap. One of them may be ignored when Revit finds room boundaries. Delete one of the lines."
B;"Highlighted walls overlap. One of them may be ignored when Revit finds room boundaries. Use Cut Geometry to embed one wall within the other."
B;"Mass contains no solid geometry. Mass Floors, volume, and surface area, won?t be computed."
B;"Elements have duplicate 'Mark' values."
B;"Room is not in a properly enclosed region"
B;"Elements have duplicate 'Number' values."
B;"Curve-Based Family is slightly off axis and may cause inaccuracies."
B;"Area separation line is slightly off axis and may cause inaccuracies."
;"A wall and a room separation line overlap. One of them may be ignored when Revit finds room boundaries. Shorten or delete the room separation line to remove the overlap."
;"Room Tag is outside of its Room.  Enable Leader or move Room Tag within its Room."
;"Two elements were not automatically joined because one or both is not editable."
;"Some panels in this curtain system are slightly malformed.  The problem is most likely ignorable. This problem usually occurs when a panel or parts of a panel have been divided so that they are very narrow.  To better see the malformed panels, temporarily hide the mullion category and set display of lines to ""thin lines"" (using the command on the view menu)."
;"Insert conflicts with joined Wall."
;"The slope of this railing may not parallel the stairs at runs and landings.  To get a parallel railing, split the railing sketch at the ends of landings. "
;"Highlighted elements are joined but do not intersect."
;"Thickness of this Floor may be slightly inaccurate due to extreme Shape Editing. Dimensions to this element in sections and details may not accurately indicate the Thickness shown in Type Properties."
;"Highlighted lines overlap. Lines may not form closed loops."
;"No columns are joined to grid lines, or view parameters exclude all columns."
;"The rail is not continuous.  Breaks in the rail usually occur at sharply-angled transitions. To fix the problem, try:  - Changing the transition style in the rail type properties, or  - Modifying the railing path at the transition."
;"Cuts on concrete members are ignored."
;"Highlighted walls overlap. One of them may be ignored when Revit finds room boundaries. Use Cut Geometry to embed one wall within the other or tab-select one of the grouped overlapping walls and exclude it from the group instance."
